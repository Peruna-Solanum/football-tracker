            <h1>About Page:</h1>
            <p>This was for fun. I wanted to learn how to make charts, and I 
                thought a fun way to do that was to take some friends and take their guesses
                on what  football team would win each game throughout a season.
            </p>
            <p>That's it, not much else to say.</p>
            
            <h2 id="listTitle"> Features:</h2>
                <ul id="list" aria-labelledby="listTitle">
                    <li class="listItem">Connects to json files using fetch</li>
                    <li class="listItem">The gray "File: " section uses the json file data to show year of the file(I would eventually show file name in another version but that would be a pain for this) </li>
                    <li class="listItem">As long as the files are made in the same format, I can plug in data from every year (other than player amount since chart js doesn't work too well with dynamic data)</li>
                    <li class="listItem">Made cursor a football using a svg url converter. Really cool. Should be done more often </li>
                    <li class="listItem">Eventually figured out how to make charts using chart.js and even was able to reuse the chart function.
                        Added the annotation/labels too</li>
                    <li class="listItem">found a really cool confetti effect (see ranking page)</li>
